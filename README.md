# Palantir UI

These styles are used by the palantir browser extension, and the associated website.

## How to use

In order to use these styles, you need a bundler that supports importing css files. Vite supports this out of the box.
When css imports are set up, simply import the package somewhere in your code:

```ts
import "@nicholas-roether/palantir-ui";
```
